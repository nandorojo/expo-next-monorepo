## Deprecated - [use this instead](https://github.com/axeldelafosse/expo-next-monorepo-example)

Months ago, there were zero monorepos that supported Expo + Next.js, so I made this one. 

In the time since, there have been a few that have kept up better with newer versions of both.

[This one by Axel Delafosse](https://github.com/axeldelafosse/expo-next-monorepo-example) has more features (Dripsy, Reanimated 2, Next.js v11, Webpack 5). I highly recommend using that instead. Moving forward, I will consider Axel's monorepo my primary one.
